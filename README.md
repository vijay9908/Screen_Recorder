# Screen_Recorder
MacOS has a built in screen capture software which when it comes to video capture has no option for window capture mode . Instead needs the portion of screen needs to be selected which isn't handy in most cases.

#Built using HTML,CSS,NodeJS,Electron.

Note: You need to have npm installed if not run 'npm install' to install all the Node Dependencies.

To build the application, run 'npm run make' in the root of the repo to build the desktop app for your operating system.
